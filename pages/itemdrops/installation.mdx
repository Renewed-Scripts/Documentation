Head over to your ox-inventory/client.lua and find the following line the function called createDrop it will look like this:
```lua
local function createDrop(dropId, data)
	local point = lib.points.new({
		coords = data.coords,
		distance = 16,
		invId = dropId,
		instance = data.instance,
		model = data.model
	})

	if point.model or client.dropprops then
		point.distance = 30
		point.onEnter = onEnterDrop
		point.onExit = onExitDrop
	else
		point.nearby = nearbyDrop
	end

	client.drops[dropId] = point
end
```

Now replace that with the following code:
```lua
	local point = lib.points.new({
		coords = data.coords,
		distance = 16,
		invId = dropId,
		instance = data.instance
	})

	client.drops[dropId] = point
```


### ADDNG A NEW DROP ITEM
Go to your ox_inventory/data/items.lua

To attach a model to that drop you have 2 options.
```lua
dropModel = `model`
modelRotation = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

dropModel is the model you want to drop MAKE SURE YOU DO `` NOT ''
modelRotation is used for making adjustments to the rotations

Here is an example of one my items:
```lua
	['burger'] = {
		label = 'Burger',
		weight = 220,
		client = {
			status = { hunger = 200000 },
			anim = 'eating',
			prop = 'burger',
			usetime = 2500,
			notification = 'You ate a delicious burger'
		},
		dropModel = `prop_cs_burger_01`,
	},
```

### SETTING A DEFAULT PROP

If you want to use another default prop then you can use the following convar like

-- Put this inside your server.cfg and change the defaultprop to whatever needs to be dropped if an item dosnt have a prop

```
## Default prop
set renewed:defaultprop "hei_prop_hei_paper_bag"
```

and thats it! Enjoy!
