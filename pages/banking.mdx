## Society Bank Access
```lua filename="qb-core/shared/jobs.lua / qb-core/shared/gangs.lua" /bankAuth = true,/
	taxi = {
		label = 'Taxi',
		defaultDuty = true,
		offDutyPay = false,
		grades = {
			['0'] = { name = 'Recruit', payment = 50 },
			['1'] = { name = 'Driver', payment = 75 },
			['2'] = { name = 'Event Driver', payment = 100 },
			['3'] = { name = 'Sales', payment = 125 },

		},
	},
```
This is already integrated in `qbx_core` by default, if you need to add to other jobs then see example below:
```lua filename="qbx_core/shared/jobs.lua / qbx_core/shared/gangs.lua" /bankAuth = true,/
['taxi'] = {
		label = 'Taxi',
		defaultDuty = true,
		offDutyPay = false,
		grades = {
            [0] = {
                name = 'Recruit',
                payment = 50
            },
			[1] = {
                name = 'Driver',
                payment = 75
            },
			[2] = {
                name = 'Event Driver',
                payment = 100
            },
			[3] = {
                name = 'Sales',
                payment = 125
            },
			[4] = {
                name = 'Manager',
                isboss = true,
                bankAuth = true,
                payment = 150
            },
        },
	},
```
