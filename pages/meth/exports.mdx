## CreateLab

Creates a new lab where the vector4 is the location of the tablet and the password is the password to access the lab. The maxUpgrades is a boolean that determines if the lab can be upgraded or not.

```lua copy
exports['Renewed-Meth']:CreateLab(coords, maxUpgrades)
```

- coords: `vector4`
- password: `string`
- maxUpgrades: `boolean`

```lua copy
exports['Renewed-Meth']:CreateLab(vector4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), "most_secure_password321", true)
```


## IsPlayerInLab

This export tells you weather or not a player is in a lab, and if they are it will return the lab ID.

```lua copy
exports['Renewed-Meth']:IsPlayerInLab(source)
```

- source: `string`
- return `number` | `nil`

```lua copy
    local isPlayerInLab = exports['Renewed-Meth']:IsPlayerInLab(source)

    print(isPlayerInLab) -- Prints lab ID if player is in lab or nil if player is not in lab
```
