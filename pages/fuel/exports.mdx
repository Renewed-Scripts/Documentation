# Exports

*This page is for developers who want to implement Renewed-Fuel within their resources.*

## Client Side

### Getters

These are used to get information from the script.

#### Statebag
- `Entity(vehicleId).state.fuel` *(Recommended)*

```lua copy
local vehicle = cache.vehicle -- Ox Lib example
local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel

-- Optimized statebags method (not recommended in loops)
lib.onCache('vehicle', function(vehicle)
    if not vehicle then
        return
    end

    local state = Entity(cache.vehicle).state
    print(state.fuel)
end)

-- Best way
lib.onCache('vehicle', function(vehicle)
    if not vehicle then
        return
    end

    SetTimeout(0, function()
        while cache.vehicle do
            print(GetVehicleFuelLevel(cache.vehicle))
            Wait(100)
        end
    end)
end)
```

#### Export

- `exports['Renewed-Fuel']:GetFuel(vehicleId)` -- *(Not recommended)*

```lua copy
local fuel, fuelType = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:GetFuel(cache.vehicle) -- ox lib example

local fuel = GetVehicleFuelLevel(vehicle) -- Recommended for huds etc.
```

#### isElectric

This is used to check if the vehicle is an electric vehicle (defined in config) without storing additional useless information in other resoruces

```lua copy
local isElectric = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:isElectric(cache.vehicle)
```

### Setters

These are used to provide values to the script such as setting vehicle fuel level.

#### **Export**
- `exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicleId, amount, fuelType)`

```lua copy
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(cache.vehicle, amount, fuelType) 
-- fueltype defaults to current fuelType or 86 if nil
```


### Gas Station Exports

#### Get Gas Station Tank Info

```lua copy
local Storage = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:GetStorage(StationId, tankId) 
-- Station ID is the ID in the db, the tankId, is 1-4 depending on how many tanks the station have 
```

#### Set Gas Station Tank Info

```lua copy
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetStorage(StationId, tankId, amount, fuelType)
-- Station ID is the ID in the db, tankId is 1-4 depending how many tanks the station have
```

## Server Side

### Getters

#### Statebag

- `Entity(vehicleId).state.fuel`

```lua copy
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(GetPlayerPed(source))
local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
local fuelType = Entity(vehicle).state.fuelType
```

### Setters

#### Export

- `exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicleId)`

```lua copy
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(GetPlayerPed(source))
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicle, amount, fuelType)
-- fueltype defaults to current fuelType or 86 if nil
```
