        Buffs are the things that can affect the vehicle (like speed, acceleration, etc) all done via handling.
        To create a buff simply have the key be the handling type you want to modify.
        and the value be the amount you want to modify it by.

        example:
        Adder - fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel is 180, and if the fuel adds 120, it becomes 300.
