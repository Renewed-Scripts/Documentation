# ðŸ““ Installation
## Step 1

Open Renewed-Fuel folder and run the SQL on your database.

## Step 2

1. Remove LegacyFuel or any other Fuel Script you used prior
1. Insert Renewed-Fuel into your server
1. Remember to add `ensure Renewed-Fuel` in your server.cfg

## Step 3

> Optional if you used ps/cdn/qb/jl/Legacy Fuel

1. Open your entire server in Visual Studio Code.
1. Now do a folder search for LegacyFuel (Or any other fuel script you used prior)
1. Now replace it with Renewed-Fuel

## Step 4

Now open ox_inventory and insert the following items into `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`

```lua copy filename="ox_inventory/data/items.lua"
oilbarrel = {
	label = 'Oil Barrel',
	stack = false,
	weight = 0,
},

driveshaft = {
	label = 'Drive Shaft',
	weight = 1000,
	stack = false
},

oilfilter = {
	label = 'Oil Filter',
	weight = 1000,
	stack = false
},

reliefstring = {
	label = 'Relief String',
	weight = 1000,
	stack = false
},

skewgear = {
	label = 'Skew Gear',
	weight = 1000,
	stack = false
},

timingchain = {
	label = 'Timing Chain',
	weight = 1000,
	stack = false
},
```

Insert the images from Renewed-Fuel into `ox_inventory/web/images` folder.

## Step 5 (optional)

If you want to use native audio for when picking/putting nozzles and fueling vehicles download this [resource](https://github.com/Renewed-Scripts/Renewed-Audiobank)

> Note: Make sure to start it in the server.cfg before Renewed-Fuel

## Step 6 (optional)

If you want players to be able to purchase stations without admin intervention add this to your server.cfg

```lua copy
# Make fuel stations purchaseable by players
setr fuel_buystations true
```
## Step 7 (optional with Renewed-Vehiclekeys)

If you want vehicles to not be started when they are out of fuel, do as followed (example taken from Renewed-Vehiclekeys)

```lua copy
if GetResourceState('Renewed-Fuel') ~= 'missing' then
local fuel = GetVehicleFuelLevel(cache.vehicle)
if fuel <= 0 then
    return notify("Vehicle can't be operated", 'error')
    end
end
```
