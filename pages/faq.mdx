# Frequently Asked Questions
Here you will find frequently asked questions and answers to help you with any issues you may have.

## How do I interact with Renewed Scripts?
Renewed Scripts currently support Dark Interaction, which can be found [here](https://github.com/darktrovx/interact).

To enable interaction, use the following convar in your `server.cfg`:
```cfg
setr renewed_useinteract "true"
```

## Why do your scripts only work with Ox Inventory?
Ox Inventory is the only open-source inventory system that has the security and features we require for our scripts.

Other free inventories, such as `qb-inventory`, are not secure and can be easily exploited. Since it's not a product we would use, we do not want to support it.

Other paid inventories, such as `qs_inventory`, are also not secure and lack many of the features that Ox Inventory offers.

## How do I get support for your scripts?
To receive support for our scripts, simply head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AS2Y8TWejt). For paid scripts, you can open a ticket or type in the Paid-Support channel. For free scripts, we have a general support channel.
