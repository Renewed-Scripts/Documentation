## How do I use interact with Renewed Scripts?
Renewed Scripts currently support Dark Interaction which can be found [Here](https://github.com/darktrovx/interact)

To enable interact use the follow convar in your `server.cfg`
```cfg
setr renewed_useinteract "true"
```

## Why do your scripts only work with Ox Inventory
Ox Inventory is the only open source inventory system that has the security and features that we require for our scripts.

Other inventories such as `qb-inventory` are not secure and can be easily exploited, since its not a product we would use we do not want to support it.

Other inventories such as `qs_inventory` are also not secure and lack half the features that Ox Inventory has.

## How do I get support for your scripts?
To recieve support for our scripts simply head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AS2Y8TWejt). for Paid scripts you can open a ticket or type in Paid-Support channel, for free we have a general support channel.
