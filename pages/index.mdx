### [Tebex](https://renewed.tebex.io/)

**__Youtube Channel:__** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3r782ck21txv8eKrDnjr7Q

## Why are the Scripts Encrypted?
In an effort to protect our intellectual property and ensure the continued development of high-quality QBCore resources, we have made the decision to implement escrow measures for most of our scripts.

## How does the Encryption Work?

If this is your first time dealing with FiveM Encryption then don't worry here's the main key points of how the FiveM Encryption work.

* When purchasing one of our paid scripts that script is automatically linked to your FiveM account, that FiveM account is then linked to your server through CFX keys, you must be using this particular account and one of the three available keys to access your product.
* You can head over to [https://keymaster.fivem.net](https://keymaster.fivem.net/?) and under Purchased Assets it should be available just a few seconds after purchase.
* &#x20;It is required that your server is using server artifacts version 4700+ update your artifacts here for [Windows ](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build\_server\_windows/master/)or here in [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build\_proot\_linux/master/).


## Common issues and Fixes

### My QBCore is outdated and I need help updating!

This is not something I can help with all my resources work with latest core if you do NOT run latest core then you can redownload it, if you need help then join the official QBCore [Discord](https://discord.gg/QBCore) or get help through their newly released [`Documentation`](https://docs.qbcore.org/).

### Outdated Server Artifacts

If you get an error saying "Outdated artifacts" or "Syntax error near line that means your artifacts are outdated and you need to update your server artifacts to version 4700 or above.

### Couldn't start Resource

If you ever come across your console saying "You lack the required entitlement to Renewed Script" then there could be various reason why that would happen such as:

* You might have purchased a resource on my tebex using an incorrect CFX account at the when you logged in, you can check in which you bought the resource and transferred you license to from the CFX control panel
* The resource(s) were transferred from your account to someone else.
* Your resource was a subscription and the original holder stopped paying the subscription.

If you believe none of these are the issues please reach out to me on discord with a tebex transaction ID and screenshot of your keymaster.

### I have more than 1 server can I use this script on them all?

Every CFX account can have up to 3 servers active, which mean yes you can use this resource on 3 servers if you need more you will have to contact CFX for extra keys or register a new CFX account and repurchase the resources.
