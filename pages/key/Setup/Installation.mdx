Step 1

    Head over to your ox_inventory/data/items.lua and find ALL of your lockpick items

    This is normally lockpick and/or advanced lockpick, now add the following to the items

```client = {
	event = 'lockpick:use'
}```

Should end up looking like this

```['lockpick'] = {
	label = 'Lockpick',
	weight = 160,
	client = {
		event = 'lockpick:use'
	}
},```

Step 2 (optional)

    Head over to ox_inventory/data/items.lua and paste in this item

```['vehiclekey'] = {
	label = 'Vehicle Key'
},```

then head over to ox_inventory/web/images.lua and put in the included from Renewed-Vehiclekeys

And that's it! Enjoy Renewed Vehicle Keys!
