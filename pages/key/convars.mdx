# ðŸ“œ Convars
Here we have a few convars that you can use to enhance your experience with Renewed Vehiclekeys.


## vehiclekeys_usetouchlesskey
This convar allows your players to enter the vehicle WITHOUT having to unlock the vehicle. This is a similar system to how teslas operates IRL.

Add the following to your server.cfg

```cfg
## 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled (Default: 0)
setr vehiclekeys_usetouchlesskey 1
```


## vehiclekeys_keyring
This convar allows your server to use the Keyring system. This is a system that allows players to store their keys in a keyring item, making it easier to store multiple keys.

Add the following to your server.cfg

```cfg
## 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled (Default: 0)
setr vehiclekeys_keyring 1
```
