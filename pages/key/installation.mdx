## Step 1

Head over to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` and find ALL of your lockpick items.

This is normally lockpick and/or advanced lockpick, now add the following to the items.

```lua copy
client = {
	event = 'lockpick:use'
}
```

Should end up looking like this.

```lua
['lockpick'] = {
	label = 'Lockpick',
	weight = 160,
	client = {
		event = 'lockpick:use'
	}
},
```

## Step 2 (optional)

Head over to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` and paste in this item.

```lua copy
['vehiclekey'] = {
	label = 'Vehicle Key'
},
```

Then head over to `ox_inventory/web/images.lua` and put in the included images from `Renewed-Vehiclekeys/image`.  
And that's it! Enjoy **Renewed Vehiclekeys**!
