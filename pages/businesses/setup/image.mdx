## Inventory Image Whitelist

Due to Imgur and Discord not allowing images to work with FiveM, we recommend adding your sites to ox_inventory and Renewed-Businesses. 


Go to ox_inventory -> modules -> utils -> server.lua, find `validHosts` and replace it with the following:

```lua copy
    local validHosts = {
        ['ibb.co'] = true,
        ['i.postimg.cc'] = true,
        ['r2.fivemanage.com'] = true
    }
```

Now head over to Renewed-Businesses -> modules -> utils -> server.lua, find `hosts` and replace it with this:

```lua copy
    hosts = {
        ['ibb.co'] = true,
        ['i.postimg.cc'] = true,
        ['r2.fivemanage.com'] = true
    },
```

This will allow the use of
https://imgbb.com/, https://i.postimg.cc/ and https://fivemanage.com/ in your whitelist URLs.

*Be sure your links end in .png or it will not work!*
