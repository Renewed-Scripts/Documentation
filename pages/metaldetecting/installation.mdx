Put these items inside your ox_inventory/data/items.lua

```lua
['metaldetector'] = {
    label = 'Metal Detector',
    price = 800,
    weight = 2000,
    stack = false,
    consume = 0,
    server = {
        export = 'Renewed-Metaldetecting.UseMetalDetector'
    },
},

['trowel'] = {
    label = 'Trowel',
    price = 400,
    weight = 2000,
    stack = false,
},
```

Remember to take the images from images and put them inside ox_inventory/web/images

And that's it! You can now use the metal detector and trowel to find items!
